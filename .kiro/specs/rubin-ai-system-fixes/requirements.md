# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Rubin AI system currently has critical issues preventing it from properly handling user queries. The system is giving inappropriate template responses (mathematical responses to programming questions), failing to connect to specialized modules, and not utilizing its enhanced capabilities. This feature will fix the core routing, response generation, and module integration issues to make the system fully functional.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user asking programming questions, I want to receive relevant programming answers, so that I get helpful information instead of mathematical template responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user asks a programming question in Russian or English THEN the system SHALL provide a relevant programming response
2. WHEN a user asks "Сравни C++ и Python для задач промышленной автоматизации" THEN the system SHALL compare C++ and Python for industrial automation tasks
3. WHEN a user asks any programming-related question THEN the system SHALL NOT respond with mathematical template responses
4. IF the question is about programming languages, frameworks, or development THEN the system SHALL route to programming knowledge base

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user asking electrical engineering questions, I want to receive proper electrical engineering answers, so that I get technical guidance instead of connection errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user asks "Как защитить электрические цепи от короткого замыкания?" THEN the system SHALL provide methods for short circuit protection
2. WHEN a user asks electrical engineering questions THEN the system SHALL NOT show "Failed to fetch" errors
3. WHEN electrical questions are detected THEN the system SHALL use the integrated electrical knowledge instead of trying to connect to port 8087
4. IF the electrical module port is unavailable THEN the system SHALL fallback to integrated electrical knowledge

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user interacting with the system, I want consistent and reliable responses, so that I don't encounter server connection failures or inappropriate routing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system analyzes a question THEN it SHALL correctly categorize the domain (programming, electrical, mathematical, etc.)
2. WHEN specialized modules are unavailable THEN the system SHALL use integrated fallback knowledge
3. WHEN the intelligent dispatcher runs THEN it SHALL properly route questions to appropriate handlers
4. IF a connection to a specialized port fails THEN the system SHALL NOT display error messages to users

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to utilize all its enhanced capabilities, so that I receive comprehensive and accurate responses across all technical domains.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL load all integrated knowledge modules (mathematical, electrical, programming, neural network)
2. WHEN a question is received THEN the system SHALL use the most appropriate knowledge source
3. WHEN the neural network is available THEN it SHALL be used for advanced question classification and learning
4. IF multiple knowledge domains are relevant THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive answers drawing from multiple sources

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper error handling and logging, so that I can diagnose issues and ensure system reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged with appropriate detail for debugging
2. WHEN modules fail to load THEN the system SHALL continue operating with available modules
3. WHEN the system encounters unknown question types THEN it SHALL provide helpful fallback responses
4. IF critical components fail THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade functionality rather than crash
